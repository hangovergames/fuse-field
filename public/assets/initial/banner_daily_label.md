Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid; use flat pastel colors with a gentle radial highlight and a 1-pixel darker outline for clarity at small sizes; keep edges clean and softly anti-aliased; apply a single overhead noon light so shadows fall concentrically beneath the object and never exceed 10 % opacity; isolate exactly one subject per file, with no elements bleeding outside the canvas; maintain one-pixel stroke weight, identical palette and micro-noise texture across every orb, crystal, grid tile and UI icon so they can be packed into a single atlas without seams or palette clashes. --- A 320×64-pixel ribbon reading “DAILY PUZZLE” in the same pixel font, parchment-tan fill, dark-brown outline, small drop shadow, left and right tails notched and trimmed to transparency.
