Create flat 2-D cartoon sprites in a bright pastel palette with soft-glow lighting and subtle 2 % micro-noise texture. Use anti-aliased edges and a gentle top-down highlight for a slightly glossy, “juicy” look. Give every sprite a 1-pixel darker outline for clarity at small sizes. Maintain one-pixel stroke weight, identical palette, highlight direction, and noise treatment across all assets so they pack seamlessly into a single atlas. Supply fully-transparent backgrounds unless the description calls for an opaque canvas. --- A 64 × 64-pixel faceted teal crystal: frosted-white body tinted pale-teal (#d2ffff) with cyan–magenta rim lights, subtle inner glow and three off-centre sparkle flecks; crisp anti-aliased edges, transparent background.
