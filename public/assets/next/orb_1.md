Create flat 2-D cartoon sprites in a bright pastel palette with soft-glow lighting and subtle 2 % micro-noise texture. Use anti-aliased edges and a gentle top-down highlight for a slightly glossy, “juicy” look. Give every sprite a 1-pixel darker outline for clarity at small sizes. Maintain one-pixel stroke weight, identical palette, highlight direction, and noise treatment across all assets so they pack seamlessly into a single atlas. Supply fully-transparent backgrounds unless the description calls for an opaque canvas. --- A 64 × 64-pixel level-1 orb: shiny pastel-coral sphere (#ff9c7d) with a soft inner glow, 2-pixel specular band starting at 11 o’clock, subtle microtexture, 1-pixel navy outline, and centred bold pixel-font numeral “1” in dark-brown (#4d2b17); cropped precisely to transparency.
