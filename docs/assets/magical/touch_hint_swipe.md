Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 256×256-pixel two-frame sprite sheet (128 pixels per frame) illustrating a ghosted finger gently swiping an orb into a grid cell. In the first frame, the translucent finger floats above a glowing orb; in the second frame, the finger completes its motion, guiding the orb into the center of the empty cell. The hand feels light, almost ethereal, as if an unseen friendly spirit were teaching the player the secret language of fusion. Both frames are trimmed to perfect transparency, allowing the gesture to feel organic and effortless.
