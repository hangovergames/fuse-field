Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 128×128-pixel level-1 magical orb, pale-blue (#aee7ff) with a soft internal glow that shimmers gently, as if tiny unseen sprites were dancing inside. Its one-pixel navy outline contains a faint, playful energy that pulses quietly with promise. A four-pixel-wide specular highlight at 11 o’clock catches the light, evoking the orb's barely contained magical pressure. Centered on its smooth surface, a bold pixelated numeral “1” in dark-brown ink feels grounded and calm. Subtle concentric ripples flicker within the orb when viewed closely, hinting at the latent power gathering deep inside, although still in its most innocent and playful state. The entire sprite is carefully cropped to full transparency, preserving a sense of delicate, lively charm.
