Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 128×128-pixel level-4 magical orb, lavender-violet (#ceadff), whose inner magic has thickened to a rich, swirling dance of luminous threads. The one-pixel navy outline holds back increasingly animated energy, while the four-pixel highlight at 11 o’clock flares with radiant warmth. Centered inside, the pixelated numeral “4” in dark-brown ink glows softly against the surrounding aura. Subtle distortions ripple outward, as if the orb’s surface occasionally flexes under the mounting magical pressure. Trimmed precisely to transparency, the orb evokes a sense of vibrant tension, still playful but more potent.
