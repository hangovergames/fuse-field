Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 64×64-pixel clipboard icon depicting twin sheets of parchment, outlined in the same dark-brown stroke style as the share icon. The forms are clean yet slightly softened, suggesting the ease and friendliness of duplicating something precious within the magical realm. Fully transparent outside the figures, the icon blends seamlessly into the game's visual language.
