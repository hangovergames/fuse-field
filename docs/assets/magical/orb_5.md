```
Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 128×128-pixel level-5 magical orb, lemon-yellow (#ffe867), charged with bright, swirling internal currents. Its internal light flickers in lively spirals, creating delicate dancing patterns against the orb’s smooth interior. The navy outline now appears almost to strain, barely containing the effervescent force within. The familiar specular highlight at 11 o’clock burns more vividly, and the bold dark-brown numeral “5” seems to hum faintly with barely suppressed power. Close inspection reveals shimmering fractures of light across the orb’s inner surface, early signs of the growing tension that will soon seek release. The sprite remains precisely cropped to transparency, capturing a moment of joyous, kinetic buildup.
