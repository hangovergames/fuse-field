Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 128×128-pixel multifaceted magical diamond formed from the fused release of orb energies. Its frosted white body refracts light into faint cyan and pink rim glows, as if whispering echoes of the playful magic once contained within. Delicate inner currents still shimmer softly beneath the crystalline surface, like distant memories of the living energy that shaped it. Three off-center sparkle flecks twinkle gently across its facets, hinting at both the orb’s explosive transformation and its enduring enchantment. The edges are precisely anti-aliased, preserving a feeling of pristine refinement, while the sprite is trimmed carefully to full transparency, capturing a moment of timeless, crystallized magic.
