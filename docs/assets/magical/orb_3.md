Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 128×128-pixel level-3 magical orb, cherry-red (#ff6a6a), glowing warmly with concentrated energy. Inside, playful motes swirl more vigorously now, as if responding to the orb’s rising internal power. The navy outline still restrains this energetic brilliance, and the familiar specular highlight at 11 o’clock gleams with a more pronounced sharpness. At its center, the bold dark-brown pixelated numeral “3” stands resilient against the deepening radiance. The surface shimmers faintly with visible waves of inner force, hinting that the orb is no longer completely at rest. Fully cropped to transparency, the orb pulses with playful urgency.
