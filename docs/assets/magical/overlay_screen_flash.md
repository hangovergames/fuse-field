Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 1024×1024-pixel full-screen magical pulse overlay. At the center, pure white light begins at 0% opacity, gradually grading outward to 40% opacity at the edges, forming a subtle ethereal glow rather than a harsh flash. The effect feels like a soft magical surge sweeping across the field after a powerful fusion or cascade, as if the very fabric of the grid momentarily shimmered with unleashed energy. Everything beyond the vignette is fully transparent, preserving seamless integration and avoiding any waste in the asset atlas.
