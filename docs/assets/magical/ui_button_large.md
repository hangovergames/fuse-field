Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 256×64-pixel rounded-rect HUD button crafted from soft parchment-tan (#f6f0e4) material, framed by a 4-pixel dark-brown (#4d2b17) outline that feels steady and inviting, like the cover of an ancient magical tome. A subtle inner shadow gives the button a gentle sense of depth, as if it had been carefully pressed into the fabric of the game world. Centered on its surface, placeholder pixel-font text “BUTTON” floats with quiet authority. Everything beyond the rounded shape is fully transparent, preserving clarity and harmony with the enchanted grid.
