PROMPT Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm.

ASSET orb_1.png A 128×128-pixel level-1 magical orb, pale-blue (#aee7ff) with a soft internal glow that shimmers gently, as if tiny unseen sprites were dancing inside. Its one-pixel navy outline contains a faint, playful energy that pulses quietly with promise. A four-pixel-wide specular highlight at 11 o’clock catches the light, evoking the orb's barely contained magical pressure. Centered on its smooth surface, a bold pixelated numeral “1” in dark-brown ink feels grounded and calm. Subtle concentric ripples flicker within the orb when viewed closely, hinting at the latent power gathering deep inside, although still in its most innocent and playful state. The entire sprite is carefully cropped to full transparency, preserving a sense of delicate, lively charm.

ASSET orb_2.png A 128×128-pixel level-2 magical orb, mint-green (#c6ffd3), carrying a stronger inner glow that flickers more energetically than before, as if playful sprites are now stirring the magic with increasing excitement. A crisp one-pixel navy outline contains the light, while a four-pixel-wide specular highlight at 11 o’clock gleams slightly brighter than in its predecessor. Centered within the orb, the bold pixelated numeral “2” in dark-brown ink floats serenely. If observed closely, tiny pulses ripple outward beneath the surface, suggesting a subtle growth of the contained magical pressure. Carefully trimmed to full transparency, the orb radiates fresh, lively momentum.

ASSET orb_3.png A 128×128-pixel level-3 magical orb, cherry-red (#ff6a6a), glowing warmly with concentrated energy. Inside, playful motes swirl more vigorously now, as if responding to the orb’s rising internal power. The navy outline still restrains this energetic brilliance, and the familiar specular highlight at 11 o’clock gleams with a more pronounced sharpness. At its center, the bold dark-brown pixelated numeral “3” stands resilient against the deepening radiance. The surface shimmers faintly with visible waves of inner force, hinting that the orb is no longer completely at rest. Fully cropped to transparency, the orb pulses with playful urgency.

ASSET orb_4.png A 128×128-pixel level-4 magical orb, lavender-violet (#ceadff), whose inner magic has thickened to a rich, swirling dance of luminous threads.
