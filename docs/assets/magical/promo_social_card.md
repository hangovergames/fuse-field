Create a crisp top-down 2D sprite on a fully transparent background, rendered at the exact pixel dimensions stated so the artwork aligns perfectly inside the Fuse Field 5×6 grid. Use soft pastel colors inspired by cheerful and cozy magical worlds, blending subtle warmth into every hue. Add a gentle radial highlight from overhead noon light, casting concentric soft-edged shadows directly beneath each object at no more than 10% opacity. Each sprite should feel playful and energetic, with a faint aura of radiant magic shimmering near the edges — a soft, living sparkle rather than sharp glints. Maintain a clean, softly anti-aliased look with one-pixel stroke weight and a consistent palette across all assets to support seamless atlas packing. Apply a micro-noise texture evenly across surfaces to add tactile depth without disrupting clarity. Each sprite must isolate exactly one subject per file, trimmed precisely to transparency with no elements bleeding outside the canvas, preserving a sense of cozy precision and lively charm. --- A 1200×630-pixel OpenGraph promotional card designed to capture the inviting magic of Fuse Field at a glance. A parchment-textured backdrop anchors the scene, where the molten-gold title logo floats proudly at center. Behind it, a faint ghost of the 5×6 grid shimmers like a hidden map, and three sample orbs scatter diagonally across the field as if caught mid-fusion. The entire canvas remains opaque for proper export to PNG or JPG, with 16-pixel rounded corners adding a handcrafted, friendly finish.
