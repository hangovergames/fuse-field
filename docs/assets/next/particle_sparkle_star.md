Create flat 2-D cartoon sprites in a bright pastel palette with soft-glow lighting and subtle 2 % micro-noise texture. Use anti-aliased edges and a gentle top-down highlight for a slightly glossy, “juicy” look. Give every sprite a 1-pixel darker outline for clarity at small sizes. Maintain one-pixel stroke weight, identical palette, highlight direction, and noise treatment across all assets so they pack seamlessly into a single atlas. Supply fully-transparent backgrounds unless the description calls for an opaque canvas. --- A 32 × 32-pixel four-point pastel star for cascades: sharp central glow, 2-pixel tapered arms, soft anisotropic blur; transparent background.
